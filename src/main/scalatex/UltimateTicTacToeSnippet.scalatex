  Long time I wanted to try @a(href:= "https://reactjs.org/", target:= "_blank"){React} and did it finally
  at the end of 2015. Because I don't like Javascript I decided for
  @a(href:= "https://clojurescript.org/", target:= "_blank"){Clojurescript}.
  I was impressed by simplicity of the language and framework as well.
  I wrote a little game you can play here. Computer is not too strong, so you have quite a big chance
  of winning.
